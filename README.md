# Ideagen-2
Remote Coding Test #2

This is a revision to the first solution I submitted in March this year.

- Change main project from Console app to class library.
- Calculate() method returns NULL if exception occured instead of previous -1 which could be a valid return value.
- Added MSTest project for purpose of unit testing.
- 4 test methods available - TestRegular, TestHandleBrackets, TestHandleNestedBrackets and TestHandleException
